# Peertransfer

In-browser secure peer-to-peer filetransfer in *three simple steps:*

1. Select the file you want to send.
2. Open the generated link on other PCs.
3. Download over a **direct**, **authenticated** and **end-to-end encrypted** line.

*Thus the file will only be available for download as long as the sender keeps his browser tab open.*

## Features

- [x] Data is sent directly peer-to-peer.
- [x] Data is transferred using end-to-end encryption (due to WebRTC).
- [x] The messages that are relayed by a server to initiate the p2p WebRTC connections are encrypted (to protect against IP leakages and man-in-the-middle attacks while initiating WebRTC).
